- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarySalimK
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, AI and data science.
- I enjoy exploring Algorithms, building predictive models and applying AI techniques to solve real world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning supervised learning and machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning.
- I'm also enhancing my skills in Python and relevant libraries such as numpy and Matplotlib.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects related to machine learning, AI research and data analysis.
- I'm particularly interested in working on open-source Projects that involve developing new algorithms or improving existing models. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at mary.salimsk@gmail.com 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love solving puzzles and challenges in my free time, which I find helps me think creatively about complex problems in Machine Learning.
